Description: From Part 1 to Part 2 based on the lecture feedback for my work I had a better look on my code and fixed the main issue which was related to exception handling. After reviewing the code I tested it and implemented a better code to handle input verfication from user. I removed background color and instead used color text to color console text. I changed the console App interface to be more User friendly and nicer to look at and use. After spending time carefully analysing the code and making sure all the issues from Part 1 were tackled, then i moved with starting the implementing of part 2 code. I changed my work approach as well and spent more time coding, testing and debugging overall.
